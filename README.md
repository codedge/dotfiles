I use a combination of [grim](https://github.com/emersion/grim) + [slurp](https://github.com/emersion/slurp) + [swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy).
With that I can take screenshot of a selected area and edit it.

[swaylock-effects](https://github.com/mortie/swaylock-effects) is an improved(more eyecandy) version of [swaylock](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock).
